> Drag and drop so simple it hurts

Browser support includes every sane browser and **IE7+**. <sub>_(Granted you polyfill the functional `Array` methods in ES5)_</sub>

# Install

You can get it on npm.

```shell
npm install dragula10 --save
```

##### Including the CSS!

There's [a few CSS styles][16] you need to incorporate in order for `dragula` to work as expected.

You can add them by including [`dist/dragula.css`][12] or [`dist/dragula.min.css`][13] in your document. If you're using Stylus, you can include the styles using the directive below.

```styl
@import 'node_modules/dragula10/dragula'
```
