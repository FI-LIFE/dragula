> Drag and drop

**Based on dragula** 3.7.2 https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula

# Install

```shell
npm i js-drag-drop
```

##### Including the CSS!

There's [a few CSS styles][16] you need to incorporate in order for `dragula` to work as expected.

You can add them by including [`dist/dragula.css`][12] or [`dist/dragula.min.css`][13] in your document. If you're using Stylus, you can include the styles using the directive below.

```styl
@import 'node_modules/js-drag-drop/js-drag-drop'
```
